# Draw from a hat

![Main-page-screenshot](./imgs/drawFromAHat-Screenshot.png)

## Description

This project started as something to implement some basic knowledge I was picking up on Javascript. It was plain and a little vanilla that needed some personal touches so I uploaded it on Github hoping that the vast community could pitch in with some of their ideas.  <br />

This projects uses Javascript, HTML, and CSS to allow users to add a list of names to a hat and randomly select a winner. 

The list of avabile names are displayed on the left column and can removed individually or all at once.

The list of winners names are displayed on the right column and can be cleared all at once.

Check out the [live page](https://yirano.github.io/drawFromAHat/src/) and see what changes you could contribute!


## Instructions to Run Locally

  If using VSCode we suggest installing a plugin to help run the html site locally, some suggested plugins:

  1. Code Runner
  2. Live Server

  After those plugins are installed you can click the play button in the upper right hand corner to run a local instance of the project.

  If you are not using VSCode we have an alertnative method to running a local instance.

  1. Make sure you have node installed 

  2. Enter the drawFromAHat directory folder through the terminal <br/>
      Be sure to to stay in the parent directory to make sure all assets load into the html site.

  3. Type the command npx http-server

  4. A local instance on localhost:8000 should spin up
